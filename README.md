# Shmup-Game

A Shoot'em Up game developed with Pygame. To play the game, just execute the "game.py" file. Press the space button to shoot at the meteors that comes from the top of the screen. To move the spaceship, press the left or right arrow keys. You start with five lives. Each time a meteor hits the spaceship, you lose one life.
